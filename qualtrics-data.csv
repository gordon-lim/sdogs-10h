0,283,"Yes, I have a paulistinha fox dog",none,due to the hair being long and straight,"great task, thanks",More than 10 hours,50,14,33,29
1,281,I have previously owned a mixed breed dog.,"Some of the breeds looked similar, Cairn and Yorkies mostly.",More time would have helped on images where the dogs were further back in the image.,The cat was a fun surprise.,1-3 hours,19,17,25,30
2,552,"Poodle, German Shepherd, Cairn Terrier, Wirehaired Terrier, Shih Tzu, Yellow Lab",Everything worked well. ,"I noticed that my brain had some issues when photos showed more than one dog -- of more than one COLOR. It would take me longer to process because seeing more than one color would confuse me for a moment. Then, after the photo would flash away, it seemed like my initial confusion of what dog I just saw would then cause a ""Oh my gosh...wait....what did I just see?"" moment.  I also would like to have a little bit more time on photos where it showed a very, very young puppy. Much like when I see baby photos (most babies -- mainly newborns -- look alike to me), very young (under 2 months old) puppies can confuse me as to why breed they are at first. Not a problem with your study at all, it's just something I've noticed about myself over the years, and I noticed it here, too. So extra time on those would have been good. ",Everything worked flawlessly with the test. Thank you :),1-3 hours,34,15,15,22

5,242,German shepherd,Task was not difficult but very long,Images where the dog is centered or there are multiple dogs,The was one picture of the cat,1-3 hours,38,14,28,31
6,400,no,"the images went by pretty quickly, and in a few of them the dog was very tiny, either far away or there was a human taking up most of the frame. I'm actually remarkably sure that one of the images about 2/3rds of the way through was a cat","well there's the aforementioned tiny dogs and cat, and also the pekingese cairn and yorkshire terrier all look pretty similar",,7-10 hours,31,23,27,33
7,474,Boxer and chihuahua,Some of the pictures were not very clear or not taken well which made it difficult to tell what breed the dog was. ,I had some difficulty on low light or far away images of dogs and had an especially hard time on images of puppies. ,This was a very interesting study and I enjoyed looking at all the images of dogs. Thank you very much and good luck on your research. ,1-3 hours,33,13,20,25
8,307,"Yes, I have had 3 different breeds of dogs. My first dog was a Chow mix. Next two are a Black Mouth Cur and a Lab/Great Dane mix.",Wasn't that difficult aside for the faces of the Cairn and Terrier being very similar so I'm not always sure which one to pick for them.,"The faces are always the first thing I try to catch as most of them have distinguished features, so as long as the face was easy to catch and no other distractions on the image I had enough time.","I'm pretty sure I saw a cat once, and I hope I wasn't going crazy about that as I wasn't sure which to pick for it haha.",4-6 hours,26,15,25,30
9,370,Yes. Most of them were mutts.,It was difficult having to be patient enough to select the breed. ,I wasn't sure what to select for the image of the cat. ,,More than 10 hours,26,15,25,32
10,279,"Yes, I have a great pyrenees lab mix","Some photos were harder than others, but the time given was enough",Photos that were of puppies of the lighting was not great. ,,1-3 hours,35,17,26,27
11,756,Toy Poodle,"While I understood the limited time, I still enjoyed this task. It not only challenged me on dog breeds, but it also introduced me to new breeds of dogs that I had never seen nor heard of before.",I think I needed time on the last test feature. I think it went by a bit too fast for me to get a better look at the images. ,"Please note: At the beginning of the test, there was a flash at the top of the page, that said: Press F11 for full page or something to that nature, However, when I went to press the F11 key, there was Disqualification message indicating that I had ""left the page"", or something to that nature. Please do not disqualify me, I was not leaving the page, I merely pressed the F11 Key, and it assumed I had left. Thank you so kindly for hearing me out, and thank you for this wonderful opportunity to participate in this study. :) ~Trina G.",1-3 hours,42,25,17,27

18,355,Basenji,"It was a simple task but some images weren't a good representation because they either included multiple dog breeds, zoom too far away, etc.","I think I had plenty of time, if anything less time and delay between choosing.","Good task, but seemed like not a lot of work went into it. Random images of cats, multiple breeds, pictures very far away.",More than 10 hours,29,15,25,29
19,374,"Yes, currently own a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a Beagle/Pitbull mix",It wasn't difficult at all other than trying to tell the difference between a Yorkshire Terrier and a Cairn.,The ones where the dogs were most black. I really needed more time to inspect it but made my best guess.,There was a cat picture. I couldn't press Cat as that wasn't an option so I think I marked it as a Border Collie.,4-6 hours,15,19,21,31
20,309,previously owned miniature poodle,"not too hard, but some of the pictures were at odd angles or very small.  the pictures with multiple dogs were a little harder.",more time on smaller or oddly angled pictures.,there was a picture of a cat mixed in there.  marked it as poodle since there was no cat option.,4-6 hours,18,21,24,29

26,255,A border terrier and an English cocker spaniel,"I have some problems with my visual cognition. Namely, it's hard for me to hold images in my head if I'm no longer looking at them. So I did find the Test Stage a bit difficult, but I did my best! NOTE: One of the images in the Test Stage was broken and didn't display, so I did have to guess on that one!","Images where the dogs were puppies, where the lighting was low, the dogs were far away, or there were multiple dogs in the photos.","Other than the one broken image during the Test Stage, nope!",1-3 hours,40,13,26,22
